<h2 id="description-">Description:</h2>
<p>Privacy has become a major concern for the end-user of free services provided by technology giants like Facebook and Google, the scandals like Cambridge Analytica or data leaks by Google + has taught us about the dangerous impacts of data falling into
    the wrong hands. Here I designed an end-to-end encrypted chatting application to address this issue. The user of my chatting application named &quot;secure.ly&quot; can stay anonymous throughout the chatting session. I have been inspired by several
    chatting/social media applications such as 4chan, Reddit, Discord, Google Allo and WhatsApp to design Secure.ly. Secure.ly is extremely lightweight secure and portable and compatible with most of the popular operating systems. My solutions to the
    privacy concern of the users will help primarily the small to medium scale business internal and communication as the user data except the login credentials will be erased as soon as the session ends.</p>
